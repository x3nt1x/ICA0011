**– What’s the difference between repository and branch in git?**  
A repository is your whole project (directories and files) that you clone on your computer.  
A branch is a version of your repository, or in other words, an independent line of development.  
A repository can contain multiple branches, which means there are multiple versions of the repository.  

**– What’s the staging environment and how does it relate to a commit?**  
Staging is a step before the commit process in git.  
That is, a commit in git is performed in two steps: staging and actual commit.  
As long as a changeset is in the staging area, git allows you to edit it as you like (replace staged files with other versions of staged files, remove changes from staging, etc.).
